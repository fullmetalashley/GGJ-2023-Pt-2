Present Scene 1 Player 1

I had always imagined that when the day came to pass down this heirloom it would be from your father to you, just like how I passed it down to him when he was a young man. 
However the desk returned to me after his passing. 
I miss him dearly, but perhaps not as much as I know you have. 
Let this desk be a reminder of him to you and our family. 
It has gone through many hardships and been passed down for generations, so please treat it with respect.
There was a time when we almost lost this previous heirloom. 
Your Great Grandfather Martin, God bless his soul where ever it may be, nearly sold it off for money during the depression but thankfully I was able to convince him to keep it. 
He never did like it and we were always struggling and I’m sure we went a few more nights hungry because of that decision, but I think it was well worth it and one day you’ll understand.
This is the most precious gift I can ever offer you Samuel, it is quite literally our family history. 
You’ll understand why someday I hope.
Love,
Grandfather Caleb.”
